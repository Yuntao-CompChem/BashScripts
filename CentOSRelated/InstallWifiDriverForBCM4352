Installation of Wifi Driver for BCM4352 in CentOS 7.6
Tricky part is there is wl-kmold and kmold-wl. The wl-kmold*nosrc.rpm is the file downloaded from online, and the kmod-wl is the product from first 6 steps.
1.	Install needed tools and packages (incase not installed) with the following commands (# means as root):
# yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'
# yum install redhat-lsb kernel-abi-whitelists
# yum install kernel-devel-$(uname -r)
2.	Configure a build tree and minimal .rpmmacros with commands ($ means as regular user. If as root, the directory will be at here: /root/rpmbuild/…):
$ mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/{BUILD,RPMS,SPECS,SOURCES,SRPMS}
$ echo -e "%_topdir $(echo $HOME)/rpmbuild\n%dist .el$(lsb_release -s -r|cut -d"." -f1).local" >> ~/.rpmmacros
3.	Download the wl-kmold (!!!)*nosrc.rpm  file from the website to /home/Downloads/:
http://elrepo.org/linux/elrepo/el7/SRPMS/wl-kmod-6_30_223_271-5.el7.elrepo.nosrc.rpm
4.	Download the Broadcom driver from broadcom website to /home/Downloads/:
http://www.broadcom.com/support/802.11
(select the Linux® STA 64-bit drivers, the file name should be : hybrid-v35_64-nodebug-pcoem-6_30_223_271.tar)
5.	Copy the downloaded file to /home/yuntao/rpmbuild/SOURCE with command:
$ cp /home/yuntao/Downloads/hybrid-v35_64-nodebug-pcoem-6_30_223_271.tar  ~/rpmbuild/SOURCE
6.	Build kmod-wl (!!!) with command:
$ rpmbuild --rebuild --define 'packager yuntao' /home/yuntao/Downloads/wl-kmod-6_30_223_271-5.el7.elrepo.nosrc.rpm
( now in the folder /home/yuntao/rpmbuild/RPMS, a new folder x86_64 should be generated. In there, it is the file used for next step: kmod-wl-6_30_223_271-4.el7.local.x86_64.rpm)
7.	Install the generated kmod-wl file with command:
$ sudo yum install ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/kmod-wl-6_30_223_271-4.el7.local.x86_64.rpm
8.	Restart or start wireless now with command (as root):
# modprobe wl
9.	Remove build tree with command:
$rm –rf ~/rpmbuild
